## How To Use
1. Get the Node.js Server in Order
    1. Add your OpenAI API key to a .env file in the "server" directory, on the same level as package.json. The varable name should be [TODO]
    2. Open a terminal in the "server" directory.
    3. Run the command `npm i` to install the required packages.
    4. Run the command `npm start` to initialize the server.
2. Connect the Arduino to the PC
   1. Assuming the Arduino is properly constructed and installed with the Troll Bridge program...
   2. Connect the Arduino to the device that will run the Node.js server via USB cable.
